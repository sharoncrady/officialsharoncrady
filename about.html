    <h2>Hybrid Artist. Creative Triathlete. Builder of Worlds.</h2>

    <p>
      Sharon Fitzgerald is a creative force who blends 
      <strong>resilience, imagination, and determination</strong> 
      into everything she builds. A solo parent, creator, and future pilot, she is
      building a life that combines <strong>aviation, creativity, digital
      craftsmanship, and personal freedom.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Sharon is the founder of <strong>OfficialSharonCrady™</strong>, a growing
      multi-division creative ecosystem spanning writing, online publishing,
      digital products, voiceover, personal development, and web development.
      She believes in turning real-life challenges into opportunities — and she
      has done exactly that.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a <strong>writer and creator</strong>, Sharon uses storytelling,
      journaling, and creative expression to inspire, heal, and awaken
      possibilities — both in herself and in others.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a <strong>voiceover and voice acting student</strong>, she is building
      the skills to perform characters, narrate stories, and bring emotional
      depth to scripts of all kinds. Her voice work is rooted in authenticity,
      expression, and lived experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a <strong>web developer</strong>, Sharon designs and builds her own
      websites from scratch — learning through doing, breaking, fixing, and
      refining. She actively develops digital spaces, creative tools, and online
      experiences that reflect her vision and growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a <strong>future pilot</strong>, Sharon is pursuing aviation training and
      preparing to enter flight school, blending her love of freedom, travel, and
      precision into a long-term professional dream.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a <strong>solo parent</strong>, she homeschools her son, teaches creativity
      and independence, and models what it looks like to build a life from
      passion, resilience, and vision.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every corner of Sharon’s world — from her writing studio to her digital
      shop to her learning journey — is built around one belief:
    </p>

    <p class="about-quote">
      <em>
        Creativity can rebuild a life.<br />
        Expression can heal.<br />
        And freedom begins when we decide to design the life we truly want.
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, you’ll find Sharon’s projects, writing, digital products, and
      works-in-progress — along with the things that inspire her along the way.
      This is where she builds, grows, dreams, and creates possibility.
