    <!-- ABOUT THIS SERIES -->
    <section class="page-card">
      <h2>About This Series</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Audio Stories</strong> is my ongoing collection of short narrative pieces:
        original fiction, reflective monologues, and small cinematic scenes brought to life
        in audio form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Episodes are designed to be easy to listen to in a single sitting—ideal for quiet evenings,
        late-night reflection, or a few minutes of emotional storytelling between the noise of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, this space will grow to include stand-alone short stories, mini-series arcs,
        and special themed collections.
