        <h2>Short, Cinematic Stories in My Voice</h2>
        <p>
            Quiet emotional turning points. Soft narrative slices of life.  
            Moments written and voiced in my own words and my own tone.
        </p>

    <!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
    <section class="page-card">
        <h2>About This Series</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Audio Stories</strong> is my ongoing collection of original fiction, reflective 
            monologues, and small cinematic scenes brought to life through my storytelling voice.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each episode is designed to be easy to listen to in a single sitting—perfect for quiet
            evenings, late-night reflection, morning grounding, or a few minutes of escape between
            the noise of the day.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over time, this series will grow to include stand-alone short stories, mini-series arcs,
            and themed collections.
